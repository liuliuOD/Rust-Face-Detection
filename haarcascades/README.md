### What is it?

`Haar Cascades` is a powerful algorithm in the realm of computer vision, offering a robust method for object detection, with applications ranging from identifying faces to detecting various objects in images or video. Developed by Viola and Jones, this technique employs a cascade of simple features known as Haar-like features, which act as effective filters applied to images.
